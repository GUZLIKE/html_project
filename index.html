    <p>We're no strangers to love
        You know the rules and so do I
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy
    </p>
    <p>I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
        Gotta make you understand
        Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you
        Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>We've known each other for so long
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
        Inside, we both know what's been going on
        We know the game, and we're gonna play it </p>
<br>
       <p> And if you ask me how I'm feeling
           Don't tell me you're too blind to see </p>
<br>
    <p> Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you
        Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
        Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you
        Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
    </p>
