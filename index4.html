    <b>He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)—the same right-hand pocket from which
        she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full possession of his faculties, free from confusion or
        giddiness, but his hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected
        and careful, trying all the time not to get smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were
        all, as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom with them. It was a very small
        room with a whole shrine of holy images. Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with a
        silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to
        fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him. He
        suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to
        go back. He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind. He
        suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the
        chest, he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman, but did not
        bring it down. There was no doubt that she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw
        clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He was about to feel it with his finger, but
        drew back his hand and indeed it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of blood. All at
        once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but the string was strong and did not snap and besides,
        it was soaked with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but something held it and
        prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but
        did not dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood, after two minutes' hurried
        effort, he cut the string and took it off without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken—it was a
        purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of copper, and an image in silver filigree,
        and with them a small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed very full;
        Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it, flung the crosses on the old woman's body and rushed
        back into the bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.</b>
